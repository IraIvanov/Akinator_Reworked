  ```
  # How to play
  
   After launching program from terminal using ./akinator you will enter the main menu of the game:
   
   
```terminal
  $./akinator 
  $What do you wanna do?
  $[P]lay, [S]how tree, [C]ompare, [G]et definition, [E]xit.    
  ```
  
  Please, imagine a character, Akinator tries to guess who it is.       
  Akinator will ask some questions, to guess who did you imagine.
  
  If Akinator don't know the character you can add it to the data base. 
  
  You can see data base of akinator by sending 'S' to the program.
  
 Also you can compare definitions of characters by 'C', and get the definition of a character by 'G'. 
  
  
  This project uses data containers such stack, list and binary tree. Libraries to interact with them were written by myself.
